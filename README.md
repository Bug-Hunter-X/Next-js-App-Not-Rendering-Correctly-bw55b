# Next.js App Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, issue in Next.js applications where the app fails to render correctly without throwing any console errors.  The problem is likely caused by incorrect configuration or missing dependencies. 

## Problem Description

The `pages/index.js` file contains a simple Next.js app. However, upon running the application (using `npm run dev`), the expected content ('Hello, world!') does not appear on the page.  The browser displays a blank page or a default Next.js error message.  Importantly, there are *no* error messages in the browser's developer console.

## Solution

The provided solution addresses the issue by ensuring the correct setup and dependencies are in place. This may include verifying the Next.js version, checking for missing or conflicting packages, and validating the app's structure.
